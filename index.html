            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Hi, I am Caio! I am currently doing school at BYUI online. My major is Software Development and it
                    has
                    been absolutely incredible!
                    I have been interested in smart contract development, smart contract security and lately I have been
                    interested in all things security - I love
                    attacking, I'd say! Well, hope you like some of my work and you can feel free to reach out at
                    anytime.
                    No, I didn't forget, I am
                    24 years old so far and it has been an awesome journey with lots of ups and downs, but I have been
                    loving it - I love life!
                </p>

                <p>I live in Brazil, which is a great country, full of natural resources! I love its rich culture, its
                    delicious food, its happy music and, yes, I love soccer!
                    "Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest and easternmost country
                    in South America and Latin America. It is the world's fifth-largest country by area and the seventh
                    largest by population, with over 203 million people. Brazil is a federation composed of 26 states
                    and a Federal District, which hosts the capital, Brasília. Its most populous city is São Paulo,
                    followed by Rio de Janeiro. Brazil has the most Portuguese speakers in the world and is the only
                    country in the Americas where Portuguese is an official language. It is among the world's
                    most multicultural and ethnically diverse nations, due to over a century of mass immigration from
                    around the world" (Wikipedia, 2025).
